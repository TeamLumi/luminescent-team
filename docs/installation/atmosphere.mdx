# Atmosphere (Switch)

## Installation

:::caution

Do not install any other mods with Luminescent Platinum! You will risk breaking your game!

:::

1. Set up Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl 1.3.0 in your emuNAND. Please use NXDumpTool to copy your personal Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl and update file to the SD and install into emuNAND. You will need two files by the end of it: the game *and* the update.
    - Any other update is *not* supported.
    - Do not play Luminescent Platinum in sysNAND, as all of the modified Pokémon and files will put your system at risk of ban.
2. Download the mod [from here](https://www.nexusmods.com/pokemonbdsp/mods/1).
3. Extract the files somewhere on your computer.
4. Open your Switch SD folder and drop just the "exefs" and "romfs" folders into atmosphere/contents/0100000011D90000/ (for BD) or 010018E011D92000 (for SP)
    - Create any folders that do not exist.
5. **THIS STEP IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE FOR SWITCH USERS**:  
   Go into the exefs folder and move the .ips file to /atmosphere/exefs_patches/Luminescent
    - Once again, create any folders that don't exist.
    - You will have to move it again for every Luminescent update you install.

## Updating the Mod

Back up your saves (using the homebrews JKSV or Checkpoint) just in case of any potential issue. Delete the old romfs and exefs files (for Switch, this includes the ones in /atmosphere/exefs_patches/Luminescent). Follow the install instructions again with the new files.

## Notes

- THIS IS A ROMHACK, NOT AN INDEPENDENT GAME. YOU MUST ALREADY OWN BRILLIANT DIAMOND OR SHINING PEARL 1.3.0 TO INSTALL THIS.
- You must be on update 1.3.0 (not 1.1.3).

## Is it working?

If you are starting a new game, the language select screen should have a gold background, and all languages except English should be crossed out. Make sure to double check that the EXP Share is off as soon as you have more than one Pokémon. If it isn't, you have a bad install. Once that's been done, you can turn it on if you so desire from the computer in a Pokémon Center.

If you have a currently running game, the Pokémon party screen should have extra options for nicknaming/changing moves of Pokémon. You can also try the EXP Share check.

## Not working?

If you have followed all of these instructions and the game still doesn't boot, please use a homebrew file reader such as NX-Shell and navigate to atmosphere/contents/0100000011D90000 and check that romfs and exefs (and the folders within) are displaying as folders as intended.

If they are instead displaying as files please make your own exefs and romfs in the appropriate spot and place the contents inside yourself. Check again in NX-Shell that everything is displaying as folders now.

You may also need to redownload the mod entirely in case of a corruption.

If you have uploaded the files through FTP, check that the file size of `exefs/subsdk1` remains the same. If it's different, your FTP client may have uploaded the mod files as ASCII instead of binary. In this case, you should force your FTP client to use binary mode. The specific steps for this will depend on the client you have used:

- Filezilla: navigate to `Edit -> Settings -> Transfers -> FTP: File Types -> Default transfer type`. Change the selection from `Auto` to `Binary`.

Once you've done this, restart the installation process, ensuring you remove the previously uploaded files of the mod.
