      <td>After beating Gardenia, find DJ in the halfway house outside of Eterna Forest and show him an eevee or eeveelution. You will receive a special Partner Eevee in return. This Eevee has 480BST, 6IVs, and knows Veevee Volley. If shown an eeveelution, you will also receive a special TM of your choice for a Partner Move originating from Let's Go Eevee.<br/><br/>
After this, he will move to Hearthome. Every time you earn a badge, you can show him a different eeveelution to receive a new move for your Partner Eevee.</td>
