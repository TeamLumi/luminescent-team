## Pokémon Changes

### BST and Type Changes

- Heavily inspired by [Renegade Platinum](https://t.co/pljSVD0yyG).
  - In 2.0, many extra changes have been added.
  - This has been done to account for additional moves, abilities, and to expand the number of Pokémon that can have viable playstyle.
- [Full pokédex documentation can be found here](https://luminescent.team/pokedex).
  - This includes new information on additional forms.

### Learnset Expansions

- Matches RP, but with many extra changes.
  - This includes egg moves, TM learnsets, level up learnsets, and evolution learnsets.
  - Some moves were removed in Generation 8. We are in the process of restoring as many as we can, but not all of them are feasible (or worth) restoring.
      - The animations of restored moves are all set to "Tackle" right now.
- Free Move Tutors have been added to the house west of Pastoria in Route 212.
- Free Move Tutors have been added to every Pokémon Center, with their list of moves expanding for every badge you earn.

### Abilities

- Updated to match Renegade Platinum, with additional changes from our balancing team.
  - Renegade Platinum had 2 ability slots. We have 3 slots, so almost every Pokémon has a new ability, with many opening up whole new playstyles.
- Frisk has gained the overworld effect of Super Luck: if a Pokémon with Frisk is in the front slot, increase the chance of wild Pokémon holding items. Happy farming.
- New [pickup table](pickup.mdx) for better progression and reason to use Pickup 'mons. We recommend using Pokétch App 5 (Pokémon List) to see when a new item is obtained.

### Grass Encounters

- Matches Renegade Platinum where possible.
  - This includes honey trees.
- Wild held items match Renegade Platinum.
- Swarms are not possible to change without causing crashes on hardware.
  - Please let us know if this causes any Pokémon to be unobtainable.
- Kecleon has been moved to simply be a grass encounter, since you can't use PokéRadar within extra-tall grass in BDSP.

### Gift, Static, and Legendary Pokémon

- All [Renegade Platinum Gift Pokémon](special-events/gifts.mdx) have been included.
  - Lumi has some new gifts for players, too!
  - Togepi egg has been adjusted into a randomized egg with a smaller pool.
  - You can save before receiving every starter for shiny hunting.
- All Renegade Platinum [static encounters](special-events/static.mdx) have been included.
  - We have added a few of our own, as well!
- All Renegade Platinum [Legendary events](special-events/legendaries.mdx) are now included.
  - These will be updated in a future update to be more exciting, with one particular event already being updated.
- All static encounters and legendaries can be repeated until caught.
  - This means if you faint them or run away, they will remain in place.
  - This allows for fast shiny hunting as well.
- There is an NPC in the Pokémon League who will allow you to release a legendary/special Pokémon to return them to their spawn point. This allows you to earn the Shiny Charm before going back to hunt them again later.

## Story & Underground Changes

### Story

- Renegade Platinum story reproduced all the way up to the post-game legendaries.
  - This does not include the Distortion World due to technical limitations of the engine.
  - The battle frontier is also not (yet?) included due to the small team size for exefs modders and the relative infancy of mapping.
- Intro sequence has been completely overhauled.
  - You will now receive the running shoes immediately, and the bike, National Dex, PokéRadar, following Pokémon, IV Judge, DS Sounds, and every Pokétch app before Roark.
- Gift items match Renegade Platinum (Roark gives an evolution stone, Bike Man gives a Dawn Stone, etc.).
- This bears mentioning again the story matches Renegade Platinum: Fantina is the third gym, and Gardenia is on Route 216.
  - Please stop reporting this as a bug/typo.
- Eterna Gym restored to full original Platinum glory.
  -  We know about the left-most fountain. It's stubborn.
- Giratina cannot be captured upon first meeting. Find it in Turnback Cave after becoming Champion.
- Most cut trees, strength boulders and rock smash rocks have been removed.

### Underground

- All Grand Underground encounters available from the start.
- No more Underground Hiker traders, as an unfortunate consequence of hijacking their store for the Heart Scale Trader.

  - Wait for Diglett/Dugtrio to disappear, as they are not able to be passed through.
  - Increased Diglett/Dugtrio odds.
