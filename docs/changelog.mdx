- The Pokédex Habitat Screen has been adjusted for all 'mons (including statics, gifts, honey trees) and is now accurate to the in-game data for 2.1 Final. (Forms do not have separate habitat screens; all data for one species is displayed on one screen.)

- Pokémon Footprints on the Pokédex have been removed to prevent issues when adding new Pokémon and accessing related data (such as Footprint Guy on Route 213).
