            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Everyone! New build of 2.0. Here's what you need to know:</p><ul><li>If you fuck up the install on hardware you'll lose your save. Please back them up.</li><li>Pikatwo (the clone Pikachu) in the last release was bugged, please release it.</li><li>This update breaks our compatibility with our PkHax-Luminescent branch. No ETA on when it will work again.</li><li>After a successful update, please visit a Pok√©mon Center and heal to update your save. Any bug reports and other help requests that have yet to do this will be ignored.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="luminescent-update-20-beta">LUMINESCENT UPDATE 2.0 BETA<a href="#luminescent-update-20-beta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LUMINESCENT UPDATE 2.0 BETA" title="Direct link to LUMINESCENT UPDATE 2.0 BETA">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Surprise: this beta includes all regional forms and attached evolutions of gens 1-4 pokemon! Think Sylveon, Alolan Marowak and Mr Rime, but not White Stripe Basculin or Hisuian Braviary. A list of their balance changes, a page of evolution methods, and a chart of their locations will be coming soon. When playing, keep in mind that the special incense items you receive will make no difference during your 2.0 playthrough; it will only matter when the full National Dex Update happens in 3.0. Make your choices with that in mind.</p><p>That said, this is not the final form of these pokemon we are implementing. </p><ul><li>Many have texturing issues that need further adjustment</li><li>You won't be able to see them at all on the evolution screen </li><li>Certain battle, idle or walking animations simply don't work (but also don't crash)</li><li>Many have "egg" as their party icon</li><li>They don't make sounds
Any bug reports to these effects will be closed without conversation. We figured you guys would want them janky but usable over perfected but waiting a lot longer.</li></ul><p>Without further ado, here's the whole lineup of our new friends!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other">Other<a href="#other" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other" title="Direct link to Other">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>700 Sylveon</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alola">Alola<a href="#alola" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alola" title="Direct link to Alola">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>19-2 Rattata ‚Üí 20-2 Raticate</li><li>26-2 Raichu</li><li>27-2 Sandshrew ‚Üí 28-2 Sandslash</li><li>37-2 Vulpix ‚Üí 38-2 Ninetales</li><li>50-2 Diglett ‚Üí 51-2 Dugtrio</li><li>52-2 Meowth ‚Üí 53-2 Persian</li><li>74-2 Geodude ‚Üí 75-2 Graveler ‚Üí 76-2 Golem</li><li>88-2 Grimer ‚Üí 89-2 Muk</li><li>103-2 Exeggutor</li><li>105-2 Marowak</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="galar">Galar<a href="#galar" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Galar" title="Direct link to Galar">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>52-3 Meowth ‚Üí 863 Perrserker</li><li>77-2 Ponyta ‚Üí 78-2 Rapidash</li><li>79-2 Slowpoke ‚Üí 80-2 Slowbro / 199-2 Slowking</li><li>83-2 Farfetch'd ‚Üí 865 Sirfetch'd</li><li>110-2 Weezing</li><li>122-2 Mr. Mime ‚Üí 866 Mr. Rime</li><li>144-2 Articuno</li><li>145-2 Zapdos</li><li>146-2 Moltres</li><li>222-2 Corsola ‚Üí 864 Cursola</li><li>263-2 Zigzagoon ‚Üí 264-2 Linoone ‚Üí 862 Obstagoon</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hisui">Hisui<a href="#hisui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hisui" title="Direct link to Hisui">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>58-2 Growlithe ‚Üí 59-2 Arcanine</li><li>100-2 Voltorb ‚Üí 101-2 Electrode</li><li>157-2 Typhlosion</li><li>211-2 Qwilfish Ô∏è‚Üí 904 Overqwill</li><li>215-2 Sneasel ‚Üí 903 Sneasler</li><li>899 Wydeer</li><li>900 Kleavor</li><li>901 Ursaluna</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="form-locations-and-evolution-methods">Form locations and evolution methods:<a href="#form-locations-and-evolution-methods" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Form locations and evolution methods:" title="Direct link to Form locations and evolution methods:">‚Äã</a></h3><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTp-J1s9zQ4Pd6n1rMU0_gg0D9lpHR_xKL8nSKbJUxc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTp-J1s9zQ4Pd6n1rMU0_gg0D9lpHR_xKL8nSKbJUxc/</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="form-bststypesmovesets">Form BSTs/types/movesets:<a href="#form-bststypesmovesets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Form BSTs/types/movesets:" title="Direct link to Form BSTs/types/movesets:">‚Äã</a></h3><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn9p53I8O6Br37bvZwLoChlLaVLkUhy447cSlIMTfyA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn9p53I8O6Br37bvZwLoChlLaVLkUhy447cSlIMTfyA/</a>
(Also, between you and me... it looks like there's someone new in the Trainer School. Wonder what happens if you talk to him a few times?)</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trainers, the time has come.
We apologize it's taken so long, but this essentially took a full rebuild of the entire storyline of the game. There's barely a single place in the game that hasn't been re-scripted. Thank you all so much for your patience.</p><p>Before you download, however, please read this:</p><p>This is 2.0 Alpha, and as an alpha, there are a few things to note.</p><ol><li><p>National Dex is not included. This remains true for the full release of 2.0 as well - we are hard at work getting it ready, but it's fair to say this is going to be one of our biggest challenges to get ready, figure out a proper distribution method, and release something that we are proud of. It's also worth mentioning that Sylveon is still not included.</p></li><li><p>Forms are not included (for the most part). We're still working on exefs challenges, so this is a little all over the place. For example, <span class="spoiler_wImb">Armored Mewtwo</span> is battleable, but not catchable (obtainable) at this time. Hisuian Growlithe is not in the wild yet due to needing a data restructure, etc. Do note, there's a couple of fun forms to find scattered throughout the game, but don't expect all of the ones we've shown off, and definitely don't expect any regionals.</p></li><li><p>You will encounter bugs. Please report them in #üêõÔ∏±support . The main point of this alpha is to get our biggest update yet polished and ready for prime-time. Please back up your saves often.</p></li><li><p>IF YOU ASK FOR THE ROM (NSP, XCI, UPDATE 1.3, OR PROD.KEYS) YOU WILL BE INSTANTLY BANNED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED</p></li></ol>]]></content:encoded>
