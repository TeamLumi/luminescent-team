# (769) _AC_DOWN

## Effect

Moves the entity of the animation down over a given amount of frames per tile.

If the **frames** argument is negative, 16 is used, or 8 if the players DashFlag is set.

If the **idle_animation** argument is provided, the entity will move while in its idle animation.

Starts the stepping sound effect.

:::info

This command only moves the entity. It does not turn the entity in the moving direction.

More research is needed on the DashFlag part.
