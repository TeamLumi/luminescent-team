# (771) _AC_RIGHT

## Effect

Moves the entity of the animation right over a given amount of frames per tile.

If the **time** argument is negative, 16 is used, or 8 if the player's DashFlag is set.

If the **idle_animation** argument is provided, the entity will move while in it's idle animation.

Starts the stepping sound effect.

:::info

This command only moves the entity. It does not turn the entity in the moving direction.

More research is needed on the DashFlag part.
