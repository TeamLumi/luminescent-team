# (29) _RET

## Synonyms

- _CHG_LOCAL_SCR

## Effect

Returns from a script call.

The exact place execution returns to is the line just after the last _CALL command that was executed. If no _CALL commands were executed, the script ends.

## Syntax

```c
_RET()
```

## Example

```c
_CALL('ev_dummy')
_SE_PLAY('S_BOO')

ev_dummy:
_SE_PLAY('S_PINPON')
_RET()
```

The above script will call the ev_dummy script.

Once there, the sound effect 'S_PINPON' plays. Then, execution returns to where the last call happened.

After returning, the sound effect 'S_BOO' plays.
