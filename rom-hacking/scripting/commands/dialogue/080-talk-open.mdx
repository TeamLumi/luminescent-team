# (80) _TALK_OPEN

## Effect

Opens a basic textbox with a pre-prepared message.

:::caution

There are no known commands to actually prepare a message beforehand, so this command ends up doing nothing.

:::

## Syntax

```c
_TALK_OPEN()
```

## Example

```c
_TALK_OPEN()
_SE_PLAY('S_PINPON')
```

The above script will try to open a textbox, but there is no prepared message so nothing happens.

Finally, the sound effect 'S_PINPON' plays.
