# Character Depth Only

There is only one vanilla character in the game that has materials that use this shader (fc1006_00 and tr1006_00 bug catcher).
However, the materials are not actually used and have no impact on the visuals when removed.

Using the shader on a material on its own results in mostly invisible geometry, more research needs to be done into further possible
applications of this shader, if any exist.
