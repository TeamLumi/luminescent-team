# LumiTool Guides

These guides are designed to serve as comprehensive explanations of how we can use a host of helpful tools to create our own Unity AssetBundles
from scratch that can be used in Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl mods. First we use AssetRipper to return assets to the Unity
Editor, in which we can manipulate them and use them as templates for our own assets, with the help of precompiled Unity Scripts. Then we can
use Unity itself to build new AssetBundle packages that we can post-process with our own in-house tool, LumiTool. Thus making the game accept them.
